** Tech Stack Milestone - JavaScript **
- With you knowledge of JavaScript, you can effectively implement interactive and dynamic features in web applications, making you a valuable asset to development teams.

MongoDB - Introduction to Database and NoSQL
- Store and organize data in a database.
- A database is an organized collection of information or data for efficient storage, retrieval, and management.
	- Data is different from information, DATA is RAW and does not carry any specific meaning.
	- INFORMATION on the other hand is a group of ORGANIZED data that contains logical meaning.

DATABASES - provide a structure way to store and manage large volumes of data, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
	- A DATABASE is managed by what is called a "database management system".

What is DBMS
	- is a system specifically designed to manage the storage, retrieval and modification of data in a database.
	- Database system allows four type of operations when it comes to handling data, namely create(insert), read(select), update and delete.
	- Collectively it is called the CRUD operations.

*** Advantage of using DBMS ***

1. Data Organization - Organizes data in a structured manner, making it easier to manage information.

2. Data Security - Provides security mechanisms to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

3. Data Consistency - Enforces rules to maintain data integrity and prevent inconsistencies.

4. Efficient Queries - Optimize queries for better performance, event on large datasets.

5. Data Sharing - Enables multiple users and applications to access and share data concurrently.

** Relational Databases **
- is a type of datase where data is stored as a set of tables with rows and columns (pretty much like atable pritned on a piece of paper).

SQL(Structured Query Language)
- is commonly associated with and used in RDBMS
- a language used to interact with relational databases

NoSQL Databases
- For unstructured data(data does not necessarily fit into a strict tabular format)
	> NoSQL Databases are commonly used
		> NoSQL means NOT ONLY SQL, NoSQL was conceptualized when capturing complex, unstructure data became more diffcult.
	> Developers can omit the process of recreating tables and backing up data and re importing them as needed on certain occasions.

- Instead of tables, NoSQL databases can come in various forms such as JSON(document-based), key-value pairs, graphs and dynamic-sized tables.

What is MongoDB?
- Part of the word humongous which then means huge or enormous
- is an open-source database and the leading NoSQL database.
- known for its document-based data model, where data is store in JSON format.
- Unlike tradition schema

- MongoDB is known for its document-based data model. its language is highly expressive, and generally friendly to those already familiar with the JSON structure.

- JSON's key-value structure naturally align with MongoDB's document-oriented approach, where data is stored as documents within collections. MongoDB's document are akin to JSON objects.
