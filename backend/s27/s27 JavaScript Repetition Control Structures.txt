** JavaScript - Repetition Control Structures **
- Create loops to repeat codes and tasks based a given condition.

1. Loops 
- Are one of the most important feature that a programming language must have.
- It lets  us execute code repeatedly in a pre-set number of time or maybe forever.

2. While Loop
- Takes a single condition. if the condition evaluates to "true", the code inside the block will run.

3. Do-While Loop
- This type of loop works a lot like the while loop. But unlike while loops, do-while loops "guarantee" that the code will be "executed at least once".

4. For Loop
- A for loop is more flexible than while and do-while loops. it consist of three parts
- The "initial value" that will track the progression of the loop
- the condition that will evaluated and will determine whether the loop will run one more time; and the iteration that indicates how to advance the loop. 
Syntax:
for (initial value; condition;  iteration) {
	statement/s;
}
