Express.js - Modules and Parameterized Routes

*** Separation of Concerns ***

Why do we have to?
> Better code readability
> Improved Scalability
> Better code maintainability

What do we separate?
> Models
> Controllers
> Routes

1. Models
> Contains WHAT objects are needed in our API
> Object schemas and relationships are defined here
	- Schemas are JSON objects that define the structure and content of documents

2. Controllers
> Contains instructions on HOW your API will perform its intended tasks
> Mongoose model queries are used here, examples are:
	- Model.find()
	- Model.findByIdAndDelete()
	- Model.findByIdAndUpdate()
3. Routes
> Defines WHEN particular controllers will be used
> A specific controller action will be called when specific HTTP method is received on a specific API endpoint

> We separate our concerns through the use of JS module that will be discussed
