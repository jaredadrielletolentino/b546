> What are middleware
	- refers to software components that sit between different parts of an applications architecture and facilitate.
	- A current example of this within our current codebase is the verify() method which sits between our route and our handler and controller.

> Middleware in ExpressJS
	- Refers to functions that have access to the request and response objects during the request-reponse cycle.
	- They can perform tasks like authentication, logging and data transformation before sending the final response to the client.
	- verify() has access to the requests and response objects as it is passed to it upon activation of our route by a client request.
