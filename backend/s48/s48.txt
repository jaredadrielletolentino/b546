Express.js API Development (Part 7) - RESTful Response
> Implementing Best Practices for creating RESTful Responses in an API

> A RESTful response, in the context of web development and REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture, refers to the data or information that a server provides to a client in response to an HTTP request. It represents the current state of a resource requested by the client.


*** Understanding Meaningful Responses ***
> In the realm of API development, a response is considered meaningful when it not only provides the requested data but also offers context, clarity, and relevancy to the client.

> It's not just about sending data back; it's about presenting that data in a way that the client can easily comprehend and utilize.

A meaningful response should ideally include:
1. Data - The core info request by the client
2. Status Info - Clear indications of the success or failure of the request (HTTP status codes)
3. Contextual Info - Info that helps the client uderstand the data, its relevances and what actions can be taken next.
4 Separating Error handling Strategies - Using detailed console logging for developers.

The Role of Informative Responses in Client-Server Interactions
1. User Experience Enhancement - Clear responses guide users, improving their exp or UEX.
2. Error Handling and Debugging - Explicit error messages assist developers in identifying and fixing issues.
3. Streamlining Client Logic - Info that helps the client understand the data, its relevances and what actions can be taken next.
4. Effective Decision Making - Info responses enable better decisions based on received data.
5. Standardization and Consistency - Meaningful responses standardize interactions, ensuring predictability and integration ease.
