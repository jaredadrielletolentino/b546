Express.js API Development (Part 2) - Registration and Authentication and JWT's

User Registration
> The process of creating a new user document in the users collection once all required info has been received.

> The password is a crucial piece of data for a user in most applications, as it is used for authentication and access control.
> It's essential to handle passwords securely to protect user accounts from unauthorized access and potential breaches.

> To handle the password securely, we can use the bcrypt

Bcrypt (Link: https://bcrypt-generator.com/)
> is a secure cryptographics hashing function commonly used for password hashing.
> It includes salting and hashing algorithms to securely store passwords.

User Authentication
> The process of verifying that a users identity is true
	- usually via a username + password combination.

> Once user identity has been proven, a JWT may be issued to the source of the request.


JWT
> Is an object that securely transmits information between parties in a compact and self-container way.
> Transmitted information can be verified and trusted because a JWT is digitally signed using a secret that only the server knows.
> It's often used for authentication, allowing users to prove who they are without repeatedly sending passwords.
> Just like when you logged in to your social media accounts.

Anatomy of a JWT
> Header (1st)
> Payload (2nd)
> Signature (3rd)

Typically has the following structure: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz or 11111.22222.33333 (the first dot is header)
