JavaScript - Array Manipulation - Non-Mutator Methods

JavaScript has built-in function and methods for arrays.
- This allows us to manipulate

- Non-Mutator methods are functions that do not modify or change an array after they're invoked.

- These methods do not manipulate the original array returning elements from an array and combining arrays and printing the output.

- Iteration methods are loops designed to perform repetitive tasks on arrays

- Iteration methods loops over all items in an array.

- Useful for manipulating array data resulting in complex tasks

- How these function works is by performing tasks that are pre-defined within an array's method.
