JavaScript - Array Manipulation - Mutator Methods

Manipulating Arrays
- Javascript has built-in functions and methods for arrays.
- This allows us to manipulate and access array items.
- Arrays can either be "mutated" or "iterated".

- Array "mutations seek to modify" the contents of an array while array "iterations aim to evaluate" each elements in an array.

Mutator Methods
- Mutator methods are functions that "mutate" or change an array after they're created.
- These methods manipulate the original array performing various tasks such as "adding" and "removing" elements.
