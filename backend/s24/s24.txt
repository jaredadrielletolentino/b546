JavaScript - Basic Functions

What are Functions?
- are blocks(group) of code designed to perform a specific task.
- they are like machines that take input data, process it, and produce output.
- just like a blender, functions take in data, perform operations on it and produce a result.
- a function in any programming language is a feature that lets us reuse our code to prevent code duplication, and promoting code efficiency.

Why use Functions?
1. Modularity - Functions help break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts, improving code readability and maintenance.

2. Code Reusability - Once defined functions can be called multiple times from different parts of the code, reducing redundancy.

3. Abstraction - Functions hide implementation details,  allowing developers to focus on high-level concepts rather than low-level code.
