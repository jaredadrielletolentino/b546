    /* 

    Problem: Find the Maximum of Two Numbers
    Problem Statement: Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the maximum of the two.

    */

// 1. Core Task
// What is the main action or result the problem is asking for?
// Example: Comparing two numbers to identify which one is larger then return that number

// Answer: Comparing two numbers to identify which one is larger


// 2. Input
// What data or values are provided to the program?
// How many inputs are required?
// Example: Two numerical inputs ( e.g num1 and num2 )

// Answer: Two numerical inputs ( e.g num1 and num2 ) 


// 3. Output
// What result or value should the program return or display?
// What type of output is expected?
// Example: A single number representing the maximum of the two inputs (num1 and num2)

// Answer: A single number representing the maximum of the two inputs (num1 and num2)


// 4. Constraints
// What limitations should the program follow? 
// Are there any specific boundaries on input size or type?
// Are there time or space complexity constraints?
// Example:
		/*	
			- The inputs can be any two valid numbers (integers or floats).
			- Should handle equal numbers by returning either one.
			- No constraints on input size (e.g., very large numbers are allowed).
			- No time or space complexity constraints for this simple problem.

// 5. Steps to Solve
// What are the main actions that the program must perform?
// Can the problem be broken down into smaller, sequential steps?
// Example Steps:
// a. [Step 1] - Receive two numbers as input
// b. [Step 2] - Compare the two numbers
// c. [Step 3] - If the first number is greater than the second, return the first number
// d. [Step 4] - Else (if the second number is greater than or equal to the first), return the second number.

/* 

// Problem: Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
// Problem Statement: Create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

*/

// 1. Core Task
// What is the main action or result the problem is asking for?
// Example: Compute and return the area of a rectangle based on its given length and width.

// 2. Input
// What data or values are provided to the program?
// How many inputs are required?
// Example: Two numerical inputs - length and width of the rectangle

// 3. Output
// What result or value should the program return or display?
// What type of output is expected?
// Example: A single number representing the calculated area of the rectangle.

// 4. Constraints
// What limitations should the program follow? 
// Are there any specific boundaries on input size or type?
// Are there time or space complexity constraints?
// Example: Length and width must be non-negative numerical values (integers or floats).

// 5. Steps to Solve
// What are the main actions that the program must perform?
// Can the problem be broken down into smaller, sequential steps?
// Example Steps:
// a. [Step 1] - Accept two inputs: length and width.
// b. [Step 2] - Verify inputs are valid (positive numbers). If not, return an error or handle invalid cases.
// c. [Step 3] - Calculate the area using a formula
// d. [Step 4] - Return the computed area.
