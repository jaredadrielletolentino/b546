- if CSS has a concept of box model, JavaScript has its own concept called document object model

- In JavaScript, each element is document object model

- An object in JavaScript contains info about a given object (such as properties and actions). In this case, the objects are the web page elements

- Using the DOM concept in JavaScript, we will be able to access or modify the properties of an element in a webpage.

- We can do a lot of things using DOM, However, we will focus on using DOM for managing form inputs
