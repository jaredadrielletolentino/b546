CSS - Introduction and CSS Selectors
- Design and style your web pages using CSS
- Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentational semantics of a document written in HTML.
- W3C or World wide web consortium developed CSS.
- in HTML4, all of the formatting could be removed from the HTML document and placed in a separate style document called CSS.

1. Id Selectors (Highest)
- are unique
- each element can have only on id
- Select ids by using a #

2. Class Selector (Second to the highest)
- targets elements according to its class attribute; ideally used for targeting multiple elements at once.

3. Attribute Selector (Third to the highest)
- targets elements with a specified element attribute; used to target elements with a certain attribute

4. Type Selector (4th to the highest)

5. Universal Selector (5th to the highest)
- targets all elements

CSS Specificity 
- This rule determines which style to apply to an element when there are multiple styles that targets the same elements.
- Rule with more specificity gets applied and the lesser one gets overridden.

The ff order prioritized style from highest to lowest priority(according to selector)
1. Id selector(Highest
2. class selector
3. attribute selector
4. type selector
5. universal selector(Lowest)

The ff order prioritizes style from highest to lowest priority
1. Inline(Highest)
2. Internal
3. External(Lowest)

CSS Selector Combinators
- is something that explains the relationship between selectors

* Four Diff combinators in CSS3
1. Adjacent sibling selector (+) - separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it immediately follows the first element, and both are children of the same parent element.

2. General sibling selector (~) - separates two selectors and matches the second elements only if it follows the first element (though not necessarily immediate)

3. Child Select (>) - separates two selectors and matches only those elements matched by the second selector that are children of elements matched by the first.

4. Descendant selector (whitespace) - typically represented by a single space char - combines two selector

5. Multiple selectors (,)


To ignore specificity add this ( !important ) property to override other rule or syntax.
