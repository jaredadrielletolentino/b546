		<h3>PREAMBLE</h3>

		<!-- p tag creates a paragraph elements. -->
		<!-- add breakline after a few words -->
		<p>The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. The clauses that <br/>are included in the full version give examples and details of how theses aspirations change the way we <br/>act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic <br/>and tedious; without the details the aspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the <br/>aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.</p>
