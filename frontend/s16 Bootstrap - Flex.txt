Session 16: Bootstrap - Flex
- Manage the one-directional layout of elements using flexbox utilities from Bootstrap.

* FLEXBOX
- it is a powerful one-direction layout model that allows modification to the layout and spacing of a group of elements.
- This model is in contrast to the grid layout where columns and rows are managed together.
- In a flexbox, elements can be laid out either horizontally(row) or vertically(column), also known as the two axesof flex box.

Flex Utility Classes
- The main diff of using bootstraps flex utility classes is that we will not need to declare our own styles by creating a css file.
- instead, classes will be used and added to element to apply certain flexbox styling.
